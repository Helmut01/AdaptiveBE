Version 0.8.3.9000
2018-04-23
     - Adapted to function names of Power2Stage 0.5-1
Version 0.8.3.9000
2017-08-29 (dedicated to my wife's 60th birthday)
     - Examples updated to reflect the latest release of Power2Stage
       df=N-3 instead of N-2 in the sample size estimation and pooled
       analysis.
     - pmethod in opt() not forced to "nct" any more. Both "shifted"
       and "exact" work with uniroot's interval=c(tol, alpha0) instead
       of c(0, alpha0). Adjusting alpha with pmethod="exact" is extremly
       slow (couple of hours).
     - TSD_Backgound.pdf added in /doc subdirectory.
     - published at GitHub
     - n2 with sampleN2.TOST() from Power2Stage.
     - Post hoc power with N-3 degrees of freedom.
     - Moved stuff to new helper().
     - New example() containing data for the validation.
Version 0.8.2
2016-10-14 (released to beta-testers)
     - Added (optional) 95% CI of TIE(s).
Version 0.8.1
2016-09-27 (released to beta-testers)
     - Added the disclaimer (from the man-page) to the output.
Version 0.8
2016-09-19 (released to beta-testers)
     - Changed the specification of PEs for clarity:
       "lin" => "ratio", "log" => "difflog".
     - Added an example with 4-element vector variabilities and missing
       PEs to the man-page.
Version 0.7
2016-06-21 (released to beta-testers)
     - If the study's specifications match any of the published methods
       check whether n1, CV1, max.n, GMR, target are within the
       validated range. If not issue a warning.
Version 0.6
2016-06-17 (not released)
     - Additional information supporting validation.
     - Estimate N in sampleN.TOST(method=pmethod) for consistency.
     - Bug corrected in assessing CI-futility.
     - CV is now correctly calculated from the CI in in the final analysis
       (one df less due to factor 'stage' in the model).
Version 0.5
2016-06-14 (not released)
     - Changed to a function and added a fair amount of input /
       consistency checking.
     - Convergence tolerance for uniroot() can be given by the argument
       tol. Defaults to 1e-8.
     - Added a plot of PE and CI (for specified and adjusted alpha).
     - In case the CVs are not given in the report, a four-element vector
       can be given in Var1 and/or Var. 1st two elements = lower and upper
       CI, 3rd element = alpha, 4th element = "CI".
       Warning: The CV based on the final CI (from Var) is only approximate
       since the factor 'stage' is not taken into account. Hence, the
       calculated CI will disagree with the report! However, this has no
       influence on the estimated TIE (based on the /interim/ data).
Version 0.4
2016-05-16 (not released)
     - Added new algorithm: Simulate a set of TIEs around the optimzed
       alpha. Fits two models (linear and quadratic), select the better
       one by minimum AIC and solve for TIE = alpha0.
       algo 1: Like in previous versions.
       algo 2: Fitted model.
     - Started to work on vectorized CV and n1 (needed for Welsh-test).
       Buggy!
Version 0.3
2016-05-11 (not released)
     - Added parallel TSDs (by Welch-test only).
     - Variabilities can be given as CV or MSE.
     - PE can be given as a ratio (backtransformed) or as a difference
       of log-means.
     - In the interim all specified conditions (N, futility conditions(s),
       alpha0 or alpha1 in Type 1 (based on power) are assessed.
     - Corrected the final analysis (one degree of less due to stage as
       a fixed effect in the model).
     - If adjustment was done, gives a statement about agreement and
       regulatory suggestions.
     - Included validation examples.
Version 0.2
2016-05-04 (not released)
     - The power analysis is now optional. Follows the boolean argument
        pa (TRUE|FALSE).
     - Added the interim analysis.
     - Tries to reconstruct the applied method from the specified type
       and alpha(s).
     - The alpha-optimzation is now optional. Skips this time-consuming
       step if the TIE with the specified alpha(s) is less or equal to
       alpha0 and the argument skip is set to TRUE.
Version 0.1
2016-05-03 (not released)
     - Merged the two optimizations functions.
     - Added power of specified alphas.
     - Enhanced the sample size plots.
     - Windows-conform line-endings (CR/LF).
     - Documents: System, user, OS, versions of R, Power2Stage, PowerTOST,
       and this code.
     - Calculates CI in the final analysis based on specified and - if
       applicable - adjusted alpha.
Version 0.0
